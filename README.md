# Grocery_Store_Customer_Segmentation
Performing customer segmention using RFM metrics and K-Means clustering algorithm

In this Project we will perform customer segmentation using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value) metrics:

- Recency : How many days since last purchae
- Frequency : How many times a customer had transaction
- Monetary Value : Total revenue generated from this customer

Based on RFM metrics, we will segment the customer using K-Means Clustering algorithm.
